1. **How do you integrate Azure DevOps Pipelines with a .NET Core application for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)?**

   - **Answer:** 
     - In Azure DevOps, you can create a build pipeline that compiles, tests, and packages the .NET Core application using tasks such as `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`, and `dotnet publish`.
     - You can then create a release pipeline that deploys the packaged application to Azure App Service or Azure Virtual Machines using deployment tasks such as `Azure App Service Deploy` or `Azure VM Deployment`.
     - Azure DevOps provides integration with Git repositories for version control, allowing you to trigger CI/CD pipelines automatically on code commits.

2. **What is Azure SQL Database Elastic Pool, and how does it benefit .NET applications with varying workload demands?**

   - **Answer:** 
     - Azure SQL Database Elastic Pool is a resource model that enables you to share and manage a pool of database resources (CPU, memory, and I/O) across multiple databases in Azure SQL Database.
     - With Elastic Pool, you can allocate and scale database resources dynamically based on workload demands, ensuring consistent performance and cost efficiency for .NET applications with fluctuating usage patterns.
     - .NET applications can benefit from Elastic Pool by optimizing resource utilization, improving scalability, and reducing management overhead compared to provisioning separate databases for each application.

3. **How do you implement Azure App Configuration in a .NET Core application, and what are its advantages over traditional configuration management methods?**

   - **Answer:** 
     - In a .NET Core application, you can use the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration` NuGet package to integrate Azure App Configuration service for managing application settings.
     - Azure App Configuration provides centralized configuration management, feature flags, and dynamic configuration updates without requiring application restarts.
     - Advantages of using Azure App Configuration include simplified configuration management, dynamic feature rollout, versioning and history tracking, and integration with Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive configuration data.

4. **Explain how Azure Key Vault can be used to securely store and manage sensitive information such as connection strings and secrets in a .NET application.**

   - **Answer:** 
     - Azure Key Vault is a cloud-based service that enables you to securely store and manage cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates.
     - In a .NET application, you can use the `Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault` NuGet packages to access secrets stored in Azure Key Vault.
     - By storing sensitive information such as connection strings, API keys, and passwords in Azure Key Vault, you can enhance security, reduce the risk of exposure, and simplify key management and rotation processes in your .NET application.

5. **How do you implement distributed caching in a .NET application using Azure Cache for Redis, and what are the benefits of using distributed caching?**

   - **Answer:** 
     - In a .NET application, you can use the `StackExchange.Redis` library to integrate with Azure Cache for Redis service for distributed caching.
     - Distributed caching allows you to store frequently accessed data in memory across multiple servers to improve performance, scalability, and reliability of your application.
     - Benefits of using distributed caching include reduced database load, improved response times, increased scalability, and enhanced fault tolerance for .NET applications with high throughput and low latency requirements.

6. **Explain the concept of Azure Functions, and how do you implement serverless computing in a .NET application using Azure Functions?**

   - **Answer:** 
     - Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-driven code without managing infrastructure.
     - In a .NET application, you can create Azure Functions using .NET Core runtime and trigger them based on events such as HTTP requests, timers, queues, or blob storage changes.
     - Azure Functions support multiple programming languages, including C#, and provide automatic scaling, pay-per-execution pricing model, and integration with other Azure services for building serverless applications with minimal operational overhead.
